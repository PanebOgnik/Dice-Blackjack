  An  implementation of Dice Blackjack by James Yates. Written in C. A link to the rules: https://www.chessandpoker.com/dice_blackjack.html
Added Single-player version, which was created first but still needs testing due to the function of the dealer, who must make decisions during the game to win against the player.
Added a blackjack version for two players with a graphical representation of the dice values.
The single-player versions have been updated to v.1.6 with a graphical representation of the dice roll.
